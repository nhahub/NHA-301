       "1      buddhism has very much lot compatible with christianity especially considering that sin and suffering are almost the same thing suffering caused wanting things shouldn want going about getting things the wrong way christian this would mean wanting things that don coincide with god will and wanting things that coincide but without the aid jesus buddhism could also seen proof god all mighty will and omnipotence certainly christians are lucky have one such christ there side but what about everyone else well many christians believe god grace salvation and buddhism god way showing grace upon others would also help study the things jesus said and see how buddha has made similar claims such rich man getting into heaven joke basically advocating that should rid ourselves material possessions fact distinctly remembered jesus making someone cry because that someone asked what achieve salvation and jesus replied with live like buddhist very very roughly translated also point out that buddha rarely spoke anything about god theory personally because knew well enough leave that jesus and mohamed who came later just remember conflict difference opinion but education can fun involving and enlightening easier teach something than prove right like intelligent design    \n",

       "1      buddhism has very much lot compatible with christianity especially considering that sin and suffering are almost the same thing suffering caused wanting things shouldn want going about getting things the wrong way christian this would mean wanting things that don coincide with god will and wanting things that coincide but without the aid jesus buddhism could also seen proof god all mighty will and omnipotence certainly christians are lucky have one such christ there side but what about everyone else well many christians believe god grace salvation and buddhism god way showing grace upon others would also help study the things jesus said and see how buddha has made similar claims such rich man getting into heaven joke basically advocating that should rid ourselves material possessions fact distinctly remembered jesus making someone cry because that someone asked what achieve salvation and jesus replied with live like buddhist very very roughly translated also point out that buddha rarely spoke anything about god theory personally because knew well enough leave that jesus and mohamed who came later just remember conflict difference opinion but education can fun involving and enlightening easier teach something than prove right like intelligent design    \n",
